# Pokedex App

Hello there! Welcome to my first ever flutter app (the name is self-explaining). 

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

## What did it do?

The app actually shows you 3 main informations:

  ### The pokemon species

  ### The pokemon abilities
